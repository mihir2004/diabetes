# diabities

This machine learning project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on relevant features. The dataset, available in CSV format, includes various parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age. The Support Vector Machine algorithm is employed for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and effectively classify data points. The project involves several key steps:

Data Collection: Utilizing a CSV file containing the dataset, which consists of information about individuals, including features that may influence diabetes.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, handling missing values, and scaling features to ensure uniformity.

Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction model.

Model Training: Implementing the Support Vector Machine algorithm to train the model using the prepared dataset.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step ensures the model's effectiveness in predicting diabetes.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the SVM model parameters to enhance its predictive capabilities.

Prediction: Deploying the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data, providing insights into the likelihood of diabetes in individuals.

Visualization: Creating visual representations, such as confusion matrices or ROC curves, to better understand the model's performance.

This project aims to contribute to the early detection of diabetes, facilitating proactive healthcare interventions for individuals at risk.
